        <h1>Meet Our Team</h1>
        <p>We are a team of passionate Computer Science students dedicated to designing and developing the Relay Bot for competitive maze racing. Over several weeks, we worked collaboratively on movement control, obstacle avoidance, line-following, and real-time communication to ensure our bots perform reliably under race conditions. Each member contributed their expertise in hardware, software, and testing to bring the project from concept to a fully functional system. Together, we combine creativity, problem-solving, and teamwork to push the Relay Bot to its full potential.</p>
